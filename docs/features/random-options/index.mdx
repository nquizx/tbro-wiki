# Random Options

## Overview

**Random options là các chỉ số được thêm vào trang bị.**

Random options là một trong những core feature được thêm vào TieubachRO nhằm tăng tính hứng thú cho người chơi.

Trang bị có random options đa số sẽ được rơi từ quái vật với một số hạn chế:

- Random options sẽ chỉ có từ trang bị rơi ra từ quái vật (không tính từ box - như Old Blue Box, Old Purple Box,... hoặc trang bị phần thưởng từ nhiệm vụ)
- Sẽ có ở mọi loại trang bị ngoại trừ Headgear (top/mid/lower), Shield và Accessory

Sẽ có từ `2 đến 3` dòng (option) tuỳ thuộc vào loại trang bị.

Đối với vũ khí (Weapon), cấp độ của vũ khí (weapon level) sẽ ảnh hưởng đến chỉ số của nó (vũ khí level 4 sẽ có chỉ số tốt hơn so với level 3, 2, 1).

Chỉ weapon level 3 được chế tạo từ Blacksmith sẽ có thể dùng để roll/enchant chỉ số, tuy nhiên sẽ cần thêm `vật phẩm đặc biệt`.
